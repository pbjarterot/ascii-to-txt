# ascii to txt
 ASCII to txt file for nicer looking mass spectrums
 The program takes ascii files exported from Compass Data-analysis (Bruker) and converts it to a txt file that can be the input for mass spectrum drawing softwares

 If changes are to be made, in order to remake the GUI .exe file, it has to be installed with pyinstaller:

    pyinstaller ascii_to_txt.py --onefile
